## Quick Start

1. Introduction:

   Installation requires __Git__ and triggers `git clone` for each configured repository to `~/zshing` by default.
   Curl is required for search.

2. Set up [Zshing]:

   ` git clone https://github.com/zakariaGatter/zshing.git ~/.zshing/zshing`

3. Configure Plugins:

   Put this at the top of your `.zshing` to use Zshing. Remove plugins you don't need, they are for illustration purposes.

   ```zsh
    # Set Plugin configuration Before ZSHING_PLUGINS
    
    ZSHING_PLUGINS=(
        "zakariaGatter/zshing"
        "zakariaGatter/MarkEdit"
        "zakariaGatter/MarkGate"
    )
   ```
