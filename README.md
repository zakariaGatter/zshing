    # Zshing Main Dir
    ZSHING_DIR="$HOME/.zshing"

    # Set Plugin configuration Before ZSHING_PLUGINS {{{
    ZSHING_PLUGINS=(
        # disable plugin, this plugin will update but won't load zsh
        "#:zakariagatter/zshing:master:gitlab:plugin:zshing"

        # load git lib from oh-my-zsh to use git_prompt_info
        ":::oh-my-zsh:lib:git"

        # load color-man plugin from oh-my-zsh
        ":::oh-my-zsh:plugin:colored-man-pages"
    )
    # }}}

    # set here all plugins Settings and arguments before you source Zshing {{{
    #}}}
